### ATLAS Project TODO list:

* `[objective 1]`: build a sequential forecasting model (LSTM, RNN, ConvLSTM) that takes in image at time t and forecasts t+1(name) [x] (**LSTM Team**)
* `[objective 1]`: create dataset for forecast model [x] (**LSTM Team**)
* `[objective 1]`: create loader for forecast model [] (**LSTM Team**) 
* `[objective 1]`: handle outliner fires fires (labeled) [x] (**LSTM Team**)
* `[objective 1]`: package task 1 tools including model structure, model training, evaluation.[] (**LSTM Team**)
* `[objective 1]`: showcase package tools [] (**LSTM Team**)




* `[objective 2]`: build a generative model (VAE, VQ-VAE) that generates an image (no necessarily in the next time step) [](**GEN Team**)
* `[objective 2]`: create dataset for generative model [] (**GEN Team**)
* `[objective 2]`: create loader for generative model [] (**GEN Team**)
* `[objective 3]`: write data assimilation class `class DA(model, sensor, R, B)` OR `class DA(model, model_data, sensor_data, R, B)` [] (**Xuan**)
